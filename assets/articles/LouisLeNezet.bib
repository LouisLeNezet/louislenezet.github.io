	abstract = {Visual and auditory impairments can have a large impact on performance in cognitive tests. It is important to evaluate the sensory capacities of dogs before enrolling them in cognitive tests, in order to exclude sensory impairment as confounding effect. Therefore we designed multiple non-invasive testing paradigms to detect subjects with potential auditory and visual impairment, without requiring extensive training for the dog. Multiple testing was a means to add internal reliability, and to reduce the risk of false positives due to habituation and previous learning or false negatives due to random errors. Our sensory test battery consisted of four subtests: (1) ‘Clapping’ auditory test, (2) ‘Recorded sound’ auditory test, (3) ‘Distance’ visual test, and (4) ‘Darkness’ visual test. The 'Clapping test' was similar to the clapping test used by veterinarians, with the addition that the clapping was performed at various distances from the dog. In the ‘Recorded sound test’, the dogs' reaction to various sounds played back at different volumes. In the ‘Distance test’ we placed a small piece of food on one of four plates placed on the grounds at varying distances from the dogs. In the 'Darkness test’, we measured the dogs' performance in walking through an S-shaped route during artificial dusk and daylight-like conditions. We were able to design two standardised tests measuring dogs’ responsiveness to visual stimuli and its variance based on a) the distance of stimuli from the dog, and b) the lighting conditions in the room. The performance in our tests requires two elements of the visual function, namely visual acuity and vision in dusk. These tests should be considered for further validation, in order to evaluate their usefulness as screening tools for the decline in dogs’ visual function. In our behaviour tests measuring the response to auditory stimuli, we found that dogs reacted similarly to different sounds. However, older dogs reacted less frequently to sounds with lower decibel, suggesting that older dogs become less reactive to auditory stimuli. The tests we developed are useful to identify subjects who do show a behavioural reaction to the stimuli typically used in cognitive tests (rewards, small objects, barriers, etc.) under various levels of artificial light. It is possible to identify the dogs’ baseline level of reactivity to visual/auditory stimuli before these are used in cognitive tests.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Genotype and low coverage sequencing data provide cost-effective avenues for genomic research but inherently exhibit the limitations of being low resolution and low quality respectively. This sparsity in genetic data poses challenges, particularly in non-model organisms lacking species-specific phased panels, necessitating accurate haplotype phasing for effective downstream analyses. Genetic imputation serves as a valuable tool to supplement these methods by completing missing data and assigning probabilities to variant observations, thus enhancing data resolution and quality. However, ensuring the reliability of imputed genotypes requires rigorous tool validation   and thorough exploration of parameter impacts  (e.g. sliding window size, effective diploid population size, number of burn-in iterations, …), critical for maximising the utility of these techniques in genomic studies.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce a nf-core compliant pipeline tailored for phasing, imputation, and validation  of the imputed data. Our pipeline equips users with advanced genomic analysis tools for phasing and imputation analysis. This enables them to leverage the full potential of their genetic data by filling in missing information, harmonising datasets, and enhancing the resolution of genetic analyses. By adhering to nf-core guidelines, our pipeline ensures users have access to a suite of high standard, versioned, and rigorously tested up-to-date tools, developed within a large and helpful community - a crucial aspect for FAIR (i.e. Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) analyses.
In summary, our dedicated nf-core pipeline offers a comprehensive solution for genomic imputation, covering phasing, target file imputation  , and imputation quality validation stages . Using this pipeline streamlines researchers' genomic investigations, harnessing innovative tools to ensure dependable imputation outcomes across various model and non-model species. Furthermore, by adhering to FAIR principles, they contribute to standardised, reproducible, and community-supported genomic analyses.},

	abstract = {Résumé De nombreuses similarités existent entre la dysplasie de la hanche du chien et la dysplasie développementale de l'Homme. L'affection évoluant beaucoup plus vite chez le chien que chez l'Homme, ce dernier représente un modèle d'étude particulièrement intéressant, d'autant que l'étiologie reste mal connue dans les deux espèces. Un programme de recherche est en cours depuis 2008, sur 5~races de chiens, pour, après détermination de l'état des hanches vis-à-vis de l'affection et réalisation de prélèvements sanguins, effectuer un séquençage génomique puis comparer les profils génomiques entre les chiens indemnes et atteints. Le but est de développer des tests de prédisposition génétiques qui permettront de diminuer l'impact de cette affection dans les races concernées, tout en améliorant la compréhension des mécanismes physiopathologiques et génétiques de cette maladie du développement, avec un double bénéfice,~en médecine humaine et vétérinaire. Summary There are many similarities between dog hip dysplasia and human developmental hip dysplasia. As the disease evolves much faster in dogs than in humans, the former represents a particularly interesting model for study, especially since the etiology remains poorly known in both species. A research program has been underway since 2008, on 5 breeds of dogs, to, after determining the condition of the hips with regard to the disease, and taking blood samples, carry out genomic sequencing and then compare the DNA profiles between the unaffected and affected dogs. The goal is to develop genetic screening tests that will reduce the impact of this disease in the concerned breeds, while improving the understanding of the pathophysiological and genetic mechanisms of this developmental disease, with a double benefit, in human and veterinary medicine.},

	abstract = {Understanding kinship relationships is fundamental to genetic research, particularly in the context of genetic linkage studies and population genetics. Pedigree design and analysis are a prerequisite for these investigations. The legacy kinship2 CRAN package has been a cornerstone in this area; however, the need for handling larger and more complex datasets necessitates an updated, flexible, and user-friendly toolset. To address this issue, we present Pedixplorer, a novel Bioconductor package designed to enhance kinship analyses with modern functionality and usability, especially in large multigeneration complex pedigrees with inbreeding loops, which are frequently seen in domestic animal breeding.Pedixplorer builds upon the robust foundation of kinship2, integrating Bioconductor standards and most recent programming practices. Its core component is the S4 Pedigree object, facilitating efficient representation of complex pedigrees. The new functions enable automatic querying, filtering, and trimming of large pedigrees, while the graphical functions have been rewritten for better customization in pedigree visualizations. Additionally, Pedixplorer offers a comprehensive Shiny application, accessible both locally and via a dedicated website, allowing non-R users to easily create, filter, and customize pedigrees.The Pedixplorer package is freely available at: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Pedixplorer.html with additional documentation at https://louislenezet.github.io/Pedixplorer. A user-friendly web application is available at: https://pedixplorer.univ-rennes.fr.},
